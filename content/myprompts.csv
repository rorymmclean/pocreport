SQL,"This tool allows the agent to run queries against a MariaDB database. It is useful for when you 
need to answer questions about employee access activities. 

The following tables and columns are the only data objects you can include in your sql statement:
    demo_access_log: (timestamp, badge, event, site, room)
    demo_emp: (badge, name, department)
    demo_site: (site, city, state)
    demo_room: (site, room, name)

The ""demo_access_log"" table is a timestamp file of employee activities. The employee is identified by the badge number. 
The event types in the demo_access_log table include: 
    ""BE"" = ""Building Entry""
    ""BX"" = ""Building Exit""
    ""RE"" = ""Room Entry""
    ""RX"" = ""Room Exit""
    
The ""demo_emp"" table translates tthe badge number to an employee name and assigned department. This table can be joined to the demo_access_log table using the ""badge"" column

The ""demo_site"" table translates the site number to a city and state for that site. This table can be joined to the demo_access_log table using the ""site"" column.

The ""demo_room"" table translates the room at a particular site into a room name. This table can be joined to the demo_access_log table using the ""site"" and ""room"" columns.
